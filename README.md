# Radiation Dose Calculator
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/0bfoolqUKHk

## Overview

Welcome to my CS50 final project presentation! I developed this Radiation Dose Calculator to estimate radiation exposure from radioactive sources. This calculator, built using HTML, CSS, and JS and integrated with a user-friendly interface, allows users to input exposure time, distance from the radiation source, and source strength (measured in Becquerels). The calculator then provides an estimate of the radiation dose, emphasizing its use for educational purposes and highlighting the importance of consulting professionals for accurate measurements.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Estimation:** Calculate radiation dose based on user-provided exposure time, distance from the source, and source strength (Becquerels).
- **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and provides clear guidance to users.
- **Calculation History:** Keep track of previous calculations for reference or comparison.
- **User-Centric Design:** Designed with a focus on user safety and education, ensuring clarity and ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** No specific backend required as this is a client-side application
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** None used for this project

## Installation and Usage

To run the Radiation Dose Calculator locally:

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Saravanakumar2003/Radiation-Dose-Calculator
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser


## Usage Example

1. Enter the exposure time (in seconds), distance from the source (in meters), and source strength (in Becquerels).
2. Click on "Calculate Dose" to see the estimated radiation dose.
3. View your calculation history or clear it using the provided options.
